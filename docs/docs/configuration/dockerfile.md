title: /Dockerfile
---

The `Dockerfile` specifies how your main development image has to be built. You can add files, install dependencies, set environment variables and run any other command. 

When you run `devspace init` or `devspace up`, the DevSpace CLI will add an exemplary `Dockerfile` for your project. You can modify the `Dockerfile` according to your needs.

See the official Docker documentation for **"[Best practices for writing Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/)"**

**Note: You don't need to install Docker, to use the DevSpace CLI.**
