title: Quickstart
---

You can easily setup a DevSpace for any existing project. This quickstart guide will walk you through the steps to get started with the DevSpace CLI:
1. [Installation of the the DevSpace client](/docs/getting-started/installation)
2. [Starting your DevSpace](/docs/getting-started/start)
3. [Coding with your DevSpace](/docs/getting-started/coding)
4. [Cleanup](/docs/getting-started/cleanup) (optional)


## Prerequiste: A Kubernetes Cluster (e.g. Minikube)
To get started, you need a Kubernetes cluster. If you do not have one yet, check out our **[Kubernetes Installation Guide](/docs/advanced/kubernetes)**.

If you already have a running Kubernetes cluster, continue with: **[1. Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation)**
