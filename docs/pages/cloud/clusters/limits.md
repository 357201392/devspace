title: Configure limits
---

DevSpace Cloud lets you define different kinds of limits:
- Cluster-wide default limits (via Clusters > Overview > Default Space Limits)
- Default limits for each cluster user (via Clusters > Users > Settings > Default Space Limits)

Editing these limits will allow you to apply the changed limits even to Spaces that have already been created and it provides the option to force-apply the limits in case there are Spaces which currently run above the limits you want to set.
