title: Manage cluster users
---

To manage the users of your connected clusters:
1. Open the Clusters view in DevSpace Cloud: [https://app.devspace.cloud/clusters](https://app.devspace.cloud/clusters)
2. Click on "Users" for the respective cluster

DevSpace Cloud provides an "Add User" button with lets you generate an invite link that you can send via email, slack etc. to allow another person to access this cluster. If someone loses access to the cluster, you can use the "Reinvite" button to generate a new invite link for this person. For every user of the cluster, you will have the option to set [user limits](/docs/cloud/clusters/limits)
