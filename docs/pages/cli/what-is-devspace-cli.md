DevSpace is an open-source command-line tool that enables your team to:
-  **Build, test and debug applications directly inside Kubernetes** and define deployment workflows
-  **Automate repetitive tasks** for image building and deployment
-  **Unify deployment workflows** among developers and across dev, staging and production

> DevSpace is a client-only, open-source dev tool for Kubernetes. It is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/devspace-cloud/devspace) and works with any Kubernetes cluster because it simply uses your kube-context, just like kubectl or helm.
