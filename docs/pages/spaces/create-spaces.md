title: Create Spaces
---

To create a Space, you can simply run:
```bash
devspace add space [SPACE_NAME]
```
Your Space name should only contain the following characters: `a-z`, `0-9`, `-`

> Creating a Space will automatically [switch to this Space](./switch-spaces).

Space names must be unique. To get a list of all your Spaces, run:
```bash
devspace list spaces
```
