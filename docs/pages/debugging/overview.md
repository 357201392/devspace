DevSpace CLI provides a set of powerful features for identifying and fixing issues with your application:
- [Analyze issues automatically](/docs/debugging/analyze)
- [View and stream container logs](/docs/debugging/logs)
- [Start terminal sessions for debugging containers](/docs/debugging/enter)

Using `kubectl` for debugging is very time-consuming and error-prone. It usually means to repeatedly lookup pod names and copy/paste them to run other commands. With DevSpace CLI, you can save a lot of time and you will never have to lookup and copy/past pod names again.
